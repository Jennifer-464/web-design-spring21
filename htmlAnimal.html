        <!-- Description of your favorite animal -->
        <p> The sea otter is a marine mammal native to the coasts 
            of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult 
            sea otters typically weigh between 14 and 45 kg, making 
            them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among 
            the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, 
            the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally 
            thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although 
            it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively 
            in the ocean.
